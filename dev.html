<p class="center">My name is Najmah Lorelei Inis Paquiul and I am eighteen years old.  I graduated with the highest honors in 2019, from Saint Catherine Academy. I was an honor roll student for all four years of high school, I also did well on my twelve CXC examinations.  I am now pursuing a Bachelor's degree in pure Mathematics(BMAT) and a minor in IT at the University of Belize.  I am also planning to do my Masters degree in Mathematics and Information Technology.  Thereafter, I intend to pursue a PHD degree in Math and Information Technology.  Like most people, I love to eat and sleep. Sometimes I would say eat too much but I really love food. I am a loner, I love to stay by myself and it brings joy to me. However, it annoys me if I am ignored, this really gets to me. Other than that, I am respectful, honest, helpful and courteous. Most people may say that I look mean but that is just my face.  I swear I am a nice person  if you  get to know me'.
